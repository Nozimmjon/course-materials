# Tools for big data

**What if your datasets are too big to fit in your computer's memory?**

* You probably don't have more than 32 or 64 GB of RAM.
* Many types of data (e.g., raster data or videos) can easily exceed that.
* Companies like Amazon and Google work with petabytes of data.

--

**What if your models are taking too long to run on your computer?**

* OLS has a closed-form solution -- $(X'X)^{-1}X'Y$ -- but complex specifications can still take a while.
* Many other statistical models take much longer, since they require numerical optimization.
* Machine learning models can take orders of magnitude longer to fit and tune.

--

**"Big data is when your workflow breaks."** -Randall Prium

---

# Tools for big data

Solutions that are suboptimal but might be good enough:

**1. Use a random sample of your data to develop your code.**
   * I.e., use only 10%, 1%, 0.001%, etc.
   * And then run it on the full dataset only once at the end.
   * Or don't -- maybe a sample is enough for your purposes!

**2. Talk someone into letting you use a more powerful computer.**
   * Not always feasible, easy, sustainable, or sufficient.
   * Check out Montana State's [high performance computing resources](https://www.montana.edu/uit/rci/hpc/).

---

# Tools for big data

Better solutions:

1. **Databases**
   * An architecture for storing and retrieving data that avoids loading the entire dataset into memory.
1. **Parallelization ("embarassingly parallel")**
   * Speed up iterations by parallelizing them across multiple cores on one computer.
1. **Distributed computing**
   * Parallelize tasks by breaking up data into chunks and handing it to multiple computers, then combining results.
1. **Cloud computing**
   * Get more computing power, memory, or processors by working on virtual machines on remote servers.

---

# Cloud computing

**Set up a virtual machine (VM) on a cloud computing platform.**
* Easy and cheap. (Much more so than setting up your own server!)
* Get billed for exactly as much power, memory, and time as you need.
* For most purposes, you won't use more than a few dollars per month.

**Platforms:**
* [Google Cloud Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/)
* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) (affiliated with RStudio).

# Distributed computing: Spark

**Spark is a "unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing."**
* Spark Core: enables distributed computing
* Spark SQL: a SQL implementation
* MLlib: An extensive machine learning library.

Spark can scale in ways that other systems can't.
* Move from a local test dataset to a massive dataset on a remote cluster, with minimal changes to your code.

Key advantage: Ability to process data both **in memory** and **on disk.**
* Deploys the optimal combination of resources for where it's deployed.

# Databases in R

---

# Databases

**Databases can help when:**
1. Your data is too large to fit into memory at once
   - And you don't actually need all of it, only parts or a summary.
1. Your data is continuously updated by other people/processes.

**Databases store data:**
* On disk, not in memory.
* On remote servers (usually, but may also be local).
* Relationally: they contain multiple tables linked by keys.

To retrieve data from a databases, we submit a **query**.
* We only get back the results of the query, not the entire raw data.
* Databases are extremely efficient at executing queries over data stored on disk.

---

# Databases and the tidyverse

Basically all databases use **SQL** (Structured Query Language).
* SQL is powerful but old and less intuitive than the tidyverse.

Fortunately, `dbplyr` makes it super easy to interact with databases from R.
* It can automatically translate tidyverse pipelines to SQL.
* You don't even *need* to learn any SQL to use databases in R.

But we'll still cover some SQL syntax.
* Knowing SQL gives you a lot more flexibility.
* And it's necessary for many data science jobs.

---

# SQLite

We'll use **SQLite** as our specific database backend.
* Not very scalable, but lightweight and open-source.
* Otherwise we would need to separately install a whole database system.

Some other (more powerful) implementations of SQL:
* **MySQL:** Open-source. Used by Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter.
* **PostgreSQL:** Open-source. Used by Instagram, Reddit.
* **Oracle** and **Microsoft SQL Server:** widespread in corporate environments.
* **Google BigQuery:** Cloud solution that you can use with `bigrquery`.

---

# R packages

Run these preliminaries:

```{r, cache=F, message=F, warning=F}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, DBI, dbplyr, RSQLite, bigrquery, nycflights13, tictoc)
```

**The R packages we'll need:**
1. `dbplyr` translates tidyverse code to SQL.
2. `DBI` helps R connect to the database.
3. A backend interface to the specific type of database we want to work with.
  * `RSQLite` provides this interface
  * And also fully embeds a SQLite database.

---

# Connecting to a database

Open an (empty) database connection via `DBI::dbConnect`:
* The first argument is always the database backend.
* Other arguments vary across database implementations.

```{r con}
lite_con = dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), path = ":memory:")
```

The path `":memory:"` creates a temporary in-memory database that we'll play around with *as if* it is a remote on-disk database.

---

# Populate some tables

Our database is empty so far.

Let's copy in our old friend, the `flights` dataframe from `nycflights13`.

```{r copy_to}
copy_to(
  dest = lite_con, 
  df = nycflights13::flights, 
  name = "flights",
  temporary = FALSE, 
  indexes = list(c("year", "month", "day"), "carrier", "tailnum", "dest")
  )
```

---

# Reference a database table

Now we can use `dplyr::tbl` to use this database table as if it were a dataframe in R:

```{r flights_db}
flights_db = tbl(lite_con, "flights")
class(flights_db)
flights_db
```

---

# Generating queries

`dbplr` will automatically translate tidyverse code to SQL.
```{r flights_db_try_queries1}
# Select columns
flights_db |> select(year:day, dep_delay, arr_delay)
```

---

# Generating queries

`dbplr` will automatically translate tidyverse code to SQL.
```{r flights_db_try_queries2}
# Filter rows
flights_db |> filter(dep_delay > 240) 
```

---

# Generating queries

`dbplr` will automatically translate tidyverse code to SQL.
```{r flights_db_try_queries3}
# Calculate the mean delay by destination
flights_db |>
  group_by(dest) |>
  summarize(delay = mean(dep_delay))
```

---

# Laziness as a virtue

Why does it say `# Source: SQL [?? x 2]`? **Evaluation is lazy.**
* `dbplyr` does as little in R as possible.
* Instead it passes everything to the database.
* It doesn't pull any data into R until you ask for it.
* It delays the analysis until the last possible moment.

**Demonstration:** How long does it take to calculate mean departure and arrival delays for each plane (i.e., unique tail number)?

---

# Laziness as a virtue

Using the `flights` data frame:
```{r tailnum_delay_tv}
tic()
tailnum_delay_tv = flights |> 
  group_by(tailnum) |>
  summarize(
    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay),
    mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay),
    n = n()
    ) |> 
  filter(n > 100) |>
  arrange(desc(mean_arr_delay))
toc()
```

---

# Laziness as a virtue

Using the `flights_db` database table:
```{r tailnum_delay_db}
tic()
tailnum_delay_db = flights_db |> 
  group_by(tailnum) |>
  summarize(
    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay),
    mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay),
    n = n()
    ) |> 
  filter(n > 100) |>
  arrange(desc(mean_arr_delay))
toc()
```
--

This code does not actually do any calculations! Or even communicate with the database!

---

# Laziness as a virtue

Only when you print the object does it generate the SQL and query the database:

```{r tailnum_delay_db_print}
tic()
print(tailnum_delay_db, n = 2)
toc()
```

Even then it only pulls down exactly as many rows as you request.

---

# Collect data into your R environment

Once you figure out what data you need, use `collect` to pull the data into a local data frame.

```{r tailnum_delay}
tailnum_delay = tailnum_delay_db |> collect()
class(tailnum_delay)
tailnum_delay
```

---

# Collect data into your R environment

Now this is a real data frame and we can use it like any other. Is there a relationship between departure and arrival delays?

```{r tailnum_delay_ggplot, out.width = "70%", fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3.2}
tailnum_delay |> ggplot(aes(x = mean_dep_delay, y = mean_arr_delay)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col="orange")
```

# SQL queries

Let's see what SQL query was generated by `dbplyr`:
.pull-left[
```{r, eval=F}
tailnum_delay_db = flights_db |> 
  group_by(tailnum) |>
  summarize(
    mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay),
    mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay),
    n = n()
    ) |> 
  filter(n > 100) |>
  arrange(desc(mean_arr_delay))
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r show_query_tailnum_delay_db}
tailnum_delay_db |> show_query()
```
]

The SQL code is arguably less elegant. It also does not follow the logical order of operations.

# Using SQL directly in R

Let's first generate a simple SQL query we can use to build on:

```{r sql_direct_translate}
flights_db |> 
  filter(dep_delay > 240) |> 
  head(5) |> 
  show_query()
```

Note: The backticks around objects (`flights` and `dep_delay`) are not strictly necessary.

---

# SQL chunks in R Markdown

When you're using R Markdown, you can directly embed SQL queries:
```{sql sql_direct_rmd, connection=lite_con}
SELECT *
FROM flights
WHERE dep_delay > 240
LIMIT 5
```

---

# SQL queries in regular R scripts

Using `DBI::dbGetQuery()`:

```{r sql_direct}
dbGetQuery(lite_con, "SELECT * FROM flights WHERE dep_delay > 240.0 LIMIT 5")
```

---

# SQL queries in regular R scripts

What tables do we have in our database?
```{r}
dbListTables(lite_con)
```

Show the columns/fields of a table:
```{r}
dbListFields(lite_con, "flights")
```

---

# SQL syntax

**From before:** Return the first 5 rows that meet a specified filter:
```{sql connection=lite_con}
SELECT *
FROM flights
WHERE dep_delay > 240
LIMIT 5
```

---

# SQL syntax

Return only selected columns:
```{sql connection=lite_con}
SELECT dep_delay, arr_delay
FROM flights
LIMIT 5
```

---

# SQL syntax

Count rows:
```{sql connection=lite_con}
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM flights
```

Count distinct/unique values:
```{sql connection=lite_con}
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT dep_delay)
FROM flights
```

---

# Challenge

`mutate(new_var = var 1 * var2)` translates to `SELECT var1 * var2 AS near_var`.

Can you translate this R code to a SQL query?

```{r, eval=F}
flights_db |>
  select(distance, air_time) |>
  mutate(speed = distance / (air_time / 60))
```





























--

```{sql connection=lite_con}
SELECT distance, air_time, distance / (air_time / 60) AS speed
FROM flights
```

---

# Joins

Joins are more flexible in SQL than R.

Let's put the `weather` data frame in the database as well:
```{r}
copy_to(
  dest = lite_con,
  df = nycflights13::weather,
  name = "weather",
  temporary = FALSE,
  indexes = list(c("year", "month", "day", "hour"))
  )
```

---

# Joins

Here's an example:
```{sql connection=lite_con}
SELECT *
FROM flights AS f
LEFT JOIN weather AS w 
ON f.year = w.year AND f.month = w.month 
  AND f.day = w.day AND f.hour = w.hour
```

---

# Tidyverse-to-SQL summary table

|tidyverse | SQL |
|--|--|
| <code>dataset &vert;></code>  | `FROM dataset` |
| `select()`     | `SELECT` |
| `filter()`     | `WHERE` |
| `mutate()`     | `SELECT ... AS` |
| `arrange()`     | `ORDER BY` |
| <code>group_by() &vert;> summarize()</code>   | `SELECT ... AS ... GROUP BY` |
| `left_join()`   | `LEFT JOIN ... ON` |
| `head()`        | `LIMIT` |

---

# More challenges

**Use SQL queries to answer these questions for year 2013:**

1. How many nonstop flights went from New York airports to Bozeman (BZN)? Return all matching rows.

2. List the number of flights to Bozeman per month, naming this column `flights_count`. Were they year-round or in specific seasons?

3. What were the top 10 longest flights out of NYC airports?

4. Ignore duplicate routes. Which 10 distinct *routes* had the longest flights?

5. **Advanced:** What percentage of flights took off in freezing temperatures? Make sure to confirm the join gives you what you want. *(Hint: First just count the number of flights that took off in temperatures below/above freezing. Calculating the percentage within SQL requires a subquery.)*

# Disconnect

When you're done using a database, make sure to **disconnect** from the connection:

```{r dbDisconnect}
dbDisconnect(lite_con)
```

# Google Cloud BigQuery

If you want to learn more SQL, I suggest you play around with **Google BigQuery** using the [web interface](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery). 
- Sandbox (Google Cloud Free Tier): Free to analyze 1 TB per month.
- Free trial of Google Cloud: Gives you a $300 credit to use for 90 days.
- Cheap after that: Half a cent per GB.

Incredible [public datasets](https://www.reddit.com/r/bigquery/wiki/datasets/). E.g.:
* All open-source code on GitHub (1.7+ TB)
* 1.9 billion comments on Reddit (546+ GB)
* 1 billion taxi trips in NYC (130+ GB)

You can get started with Google's tutorial on [how to query a public dataset](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/query-public-dataset-console).
